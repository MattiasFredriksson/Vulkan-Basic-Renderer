Points of interest:

Fixed shaders (recompiled correct layout)
Fixed Vertex validation error

Issues:

Creating process does not work for me, it returns OK but crashes, might be missing something in the folder (copied .exe to the folder)
ImageViews+SurfaceKHR destruction isn't working properly (due to images not created properly?)

Todo:

Render commands
Create descriptors and a descriptor set in the materials
