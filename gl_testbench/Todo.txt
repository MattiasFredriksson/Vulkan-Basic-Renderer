Issues:

ImageViews+SurfaceKHR destruction isn't working properly (due to images not created properly?)
Remove the gatherMemoryInfo() func commented in VulkanConstruct

Todo:

Vertex attributes (complete?)
Images (ill start looking in to it later today /M)
Shader parsing/loading
Render commands
...
