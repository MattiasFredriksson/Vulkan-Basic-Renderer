Points of interest:

Created a render frame base (framebuffer, acquisation, present...), it 'seems' to be working ;)
Fixed shutdown crash issue by letting swapchain destruction destroy it's images.

Issues:

A 'few' objects not destroyed.

Todo:

Render stuff
Create descriptors and a descriptor set in the materials
